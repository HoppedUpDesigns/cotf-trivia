I need to add an input box to this code in the QuizDetailsScreen:

return (
    <PageCenter light justifyCenter>
      <CenterCardContainer>
        <LogoContainer>
          <AppLogo />
        </LogoContainer>
        <AppTitle>COTF TRIVIA</AppTitle>
        <DetailTextContainer>
          <DetailText>
            Selected Quiz Topic: <HighlightedText>{selectedQuizTopic}</HighlightedText>
          </DetailText>
          <DetailText>
            Total questions available in the selected quiz:{' '}
            <HighlightedText>{getTopicQuestionCount()}</HighlightedText>
          </DetailText>
          <DetailText>
            You will have 10 seconds to answer each question in the quiz
          </DetailText>
          <DetailText>
            To save time, you can skip questions. Skipped questions will show up at the
            end of the quiz.
          </DetailText>
        </DetailTextContainer>
        <Button
          text="Start"
          icon={<StartIcon />}
          iconPosition="left"
          onClick={goToQuestionScreen}
          bold
        />
      </CenterCardContainer>
    </PageCenter>
  )
}

This input box will added to the code right above this section in the code:
          <DetailText>
            You will have 10 seconds to answer each question in the quiz
          </DetailText>

This input box will display this text prompt on the page to the user: "How many questions would you like to attempt?"

The input box will only accepts numbers as input. The input box should be a input box that the user can type the number into, not a dropdown menu. The user must enter a minimum of 1 into the input box and they can only add a maximum of the getTopicQuestionCount value based on the selectedQuizTopic value. The input box with the text will be something like this:
          <DetailText>
          <input
            You will have 10 seconds to answer each question in the quiz
            />
          </DetailText>

Return to me the 100% complete, merged source code for the QuizDetailsScreen. Do not comment out any of the existing code that works. Return it to me as is. Just put your changes where they need to go and leave the source code that works and is needed alone.
