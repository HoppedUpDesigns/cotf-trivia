1. Selected Quiz Topic: AMORY WARS
The value "AMORY WARS" is retrieved from the function:  selectedQuizTopic

2. "Total questions available from this quiz: 100"
The "100" in the line above is retrieved from a function called totalQuestions which is found in each
of the /cotf/src/data/QuizQuestions/ files (so for our example there are 100 totalQuestions in the "AMORY WARS" quiz)

"How many questions do you want to attempt?
Right beside this line "How many questions do you want to attempt?" should be an input box where the user can enter the number of questions they want to be quizzed on based upon the totalQuestions available for the quiz (in our example the user selected the quiz Topic AMORY WARS). The user must enter a number in this input box between 1 and the totalQuestions available from the selected quiz topic (in our example the user selected the quiz Topic AMORY WARS). So a new function called something like userSelectedQuestions

"Total score possible in your quiz" 
This line is based on the number of questions the user entered to be quizzed on in the input box above.
They will get 5 ponts for each question answered correctly multiplied by the number of questions the user entered to be quizzed on in the input box above.(in our example the user selected the quiz Topic AMORY WARS). So if the user enters 20 in the input box using the function userSelectedQuestions, they will have a possible score of 100 based on a function named something like userSelectedMaxScore
