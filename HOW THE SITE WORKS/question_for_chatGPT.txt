So now that you have all the files you need a see how the cotf Quiz App should function, it is time to analyze the code to find the problems that preventing the app to compile and build properly when the command "npm run build" is typed into the Terminal app on my Macbook. So of the things that I think may be causing issues are:

1. wrong file paths in the import statements. These need to be checked to make sure all import statements in all the files are pointing to the right place using the correct path to the needed file.
2. the types.ts file is missing types that are needed by other files in the app or the types in the types.ts are imcomplete and are missing important properties that other files need in order for the app to function in the expected manner.
3. the way that data is routed and/or fetched from the QuizQuestions/ files is wrong and the logic needs to be fixed so that all aspects of the quiz is retrieved and displayed properly to the user.
4. There might be sections of the code that are just comments and these comments need to be replaced with the actual source code with all the logic added to that section of the file.
5. Redundancy in named const, types, properties, etc so that the app is referencing a different type or const that has a similar name to the one it needs (i.e. pointing to the question const instead of the questions const).
6. Problems with the /cotf/src/components/ui/QuestionCountInput.tsx file that is preventing it from intregrating with the rest of the app so that the app functions as expected. For example, how the QuizDetailsScreen and the ResultScreen interact with the /cotf/src/components/ui/QuestionCountInput.tsx file

These are just some of my guesses as to what is preventing the app to build properly.

I want you to analyze all the source code in all of the files that I sent you above. Explain the files for problems that need to be fixed so that when I go to build the app using "npm run build" on the command line, the app compiles properly and will be ready to deploy.

I want you to give me back every file that needs to be changed. In fact, I want you to go ahead and merge your changes to the existing source code for the files as they currently are based on the source code that I have sent you in previous messages.

Return to me the complete source code for each file. Do not insert comments say something like "add the real logic here", go ahead and add the necessary source code to that file instead of writing a comment.

Return to me detailed, step by step instructions on how to make these changes. Return these files to me with the file paths of these files and the completed source code for that file in the following format:
Step 1: /cotf/src/components/ui/QuestionCountInput.tsx
// Then the complete source code for that file

Search the entire app source code to find every problem and fix those problems.
