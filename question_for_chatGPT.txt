Take the persona of an expert ReactJS programmer. Using the Quiz App with the folder structure that I gave you before, Create a Previous Button that is styled exactly like the Next Button on the /src/components/QuestionScreen/Question/index.tsx screen. The Previous Button should be to the left of the Skip Button. So the order of the Buttons on the /src/components/QuestionScreen/Question/index.tsx screen will be Previous Button, Skip Button, Next Button as you go left to right on the /src/components/QuestionScreen/Question/index.tsx screen that is shown to the user. This Previous button will work exactly like the Next Button on the /src/components/QuestionScreen/Question/index.tsx screen but will allow the user to go back to the Previous question in the quiz. The user can use the Previous Button to go all the way back to the first question in the quiz if they want to. The Previous Button will have the previous.svg icon aligned to the left/center of the word Previous just like the Next Button on the /src/components/QuestionScreen/Question/index.tsx screen has the next.svg icon aligned to the right/center of the word Next. The Previous Button will have the same width, height, background color, font size, and all the other styles that have been assigned to the Next Button including the same @media query settings. Don't add any styles to the Previous Button that is not already on the Next Button. Give me detailed, step by step instructions on how this component is added to the /src/components/QuestionScreen/Question/index.tsx screen and tell me every change that needs to be made on any and all folders and/or files that work to make the Previous Button function properly. Merge the new code for the Previous Button in each file that needs to be changed will the code that is already in that file. Do not give me comments like {/* Add the SVG icon here */}, just go ahead and put the necessary code in that section automatically. The path to the previous.svg icon is /src/assets/icons/previous.svg For each step of the process, give me the name of the file that needs to be edited  and the path to that file and/or folder in the same format as /src/components/QuizDetailsScreen/index.tsx
